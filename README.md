Files pertaining to my university project for Data Management Fundamentals
This project focused on the implementation of SQL database in MariaDB. The database was designed and implemented using MySQL Workbench and populated using python.
It demonstrates my ability to clean and organise data using python. Design a SQL database in the third normal form and automate the population process using python with sqlalchemy.
